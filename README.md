Forked from Camera2 Basic Sample
================================

This sample demonstrates how to use the new Camera2 APIs to render a preview of a camera's viewport, capture an image and save it to the device's storage.

Original resides at https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/tree/master/android5.0/Camera2Basic (as of 2018-06-24)

This version just adds a periodic picture-taking capability (useful for timelapse, capturing images for ML training, etc.)
